# Todoist Template Adder

A Python script for easily creating Todoist projects from templates.

## Features

- Uses the CSV template file generated by the Todoist app
- Supports labels
- Supports due dates
- Supports nested tasks up to 2 levels
- Place `$project` in your task to have it replaced with the project name

## Prerequisites

- Requires Python verion 3.8 or above

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository on your local machine

2. Install required libraries

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create **todoist_api_key.txt** and paste your API token

4. Run the script

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

**Tip:** I personally use a combination of the [Wox Launcher](http://www.wox.one/) and a windows batch file for easy and smooth usage.

## Issues & Enhancements

- Doesn't support nested tasks of more than 2 levels
